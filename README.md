# Calculator
A calculator obeying the BEDMAS order of precedence. Through string manipulation, numbers and operators are extracted to form two dynamically allocated arrays, where calculations are then performed using both abstract data types, accounting for the order in which they are performed. Complete with a menu, this program ensures an efficient and user-friendly experience.
